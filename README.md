# startup-wkend-cambridge-blockchain

Our idea for the blockchain startup weekend in Cambridge was BlockPaw - an immutable ledger to track the life and health of a pet. 

We came 3rd overall in the competition...

Included here is some of the rough code we did over the weekend... I'll tidy these up over the next few days...

Demo folder contains all the web stuff we hacked together for the demo...

The website is available at
https://www.blockpaw.com

and the demo app is at

blockchain folder contains the commands required to bootstrap hyperledger onto a centOS machine... I'll update this in the next few days with cloudformation templates to recreate the AWS environment we built to test out the hypothesis of using blockchain as our immutable ledger...
